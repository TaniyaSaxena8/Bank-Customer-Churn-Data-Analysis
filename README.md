# Bank-Customers-Churn-Data-Analysis
**OBJECTIVE:**

The project aims to help the bank understand customer churn behavior better and make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention, leading to increased customer satisfaction and long-term profitability.

The main goals of the project are as follows:

**1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Understand the overall structure of the dataset and its key features.

Explore the distribution of churned and non-churned customers.

Identify patterns, trends, and correlations between various customer attributes and churn.

**2.	Identify Factors Influencing Churn:**
   
Determine the most critical factors that contribute to customer churn.

Analyze the relationship between customer churn and attributes like account balance, credit score, age, gender, etc.

**3.	Data Visualization in Power BI:**

Present the findings of the EDA in an interactive and visually appealing manner.

Design informative and insightful dashboards and visualizations to communicate complex patterns effectively.



**DATASET:**

The dataset was taken from Kaggle. There are a total of 10,000 customer data from Germany, Spain, and France.

DatasetThe dataset was cleaned and transformed using power query in PowerBI.



**EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:**

1.	Use Python and popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn to perform exploratory data analysis.
   
2.	Explore the data distribution, missing values, and outliers.
   
3.	Generate descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, for key features related to churn.
   
4.	Create visualizations like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to gain insights into different aspects of the data.
   
5.	Values count of customers based on different features of the dataset:
